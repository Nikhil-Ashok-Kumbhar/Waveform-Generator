# Waveform-Generator

Overview
The goal of this project is to design a low cost (<$10) system capable of generating various waveforms on
two analog outputs while also providing two analog inputs allow measurement of the amplitude of a
signal, providing feedback for automatic level control and load impedance estimation
This project has a command line interface capable of controlling the system and providing measurement
data back to the user.

# Waveform-Generator

Overview
The goal of this project is to design a low cost (<$10) system capable of generating various waveforms on
two analog outputs while also providing two analog inputs allow measurement of the amplitude of a
signal, providing feedback for automatic level control and load impedance estimation
This project has a command line interface capable of controlling the system and providing measurement
data back to the user.
This project can be used for several subsequent purposes, including a complex baseband modulation
source for the RF systems engineering course (EE 5331).
A collection of most major parts will be provided.. The pc boards, tools, and any optional items are not
included in this collection of parts.
